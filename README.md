These lessons help learners understand how programs work and make decisions. It also introduces Python data structures, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. These lessons and exercises have been practiced and now are being applied by building a simple shopping cart program. It covers writing functions and working with modules. There's also how to import modules, organize code, build a rectangle calculator, and handle errors using exception handling.
